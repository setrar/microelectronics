# CMC Microsystems

[CMC.ca](https://CMC.ca) refers to the website for **CMC Microsystems**, a Canadian organization that supports researchers and innovators in the fields of microelectronics, nanotechnology, photonics, and embedded systems. CMC Microsystems provides access to design tools, fabrication services, and prototyping facilities, enabling academic and industrial users to develop and test new technologies.

The organization plays a crucial role in the Canadian research and development ecosystem by facilitating the creation of prototypes, supporting training and education, and fostering collaboration between academia and industry. CMC Microsystems also offers various resources, including software, hardware, and expertise, to help advance research projects from concept to commercialization.

## Where are the CMC labs located?

CMC Microsystems itself does not have physical labs, but rather it facilitates access to a network of labs and resources across Canada. These resources are hosted at various universities and research institutions, which are part of CMC's network. The locations include major universities with strong programs in microelectronics, nanotechnology, photonics, and related fields.

Some of the universities that are part of the CMC Microsystems network include:

- **University of Toronto** (Toronto, Ontario)
- **McGill University** (Montreal, Quebec)
- **University of British Columbia** (Vancouver, British Columbia)
- **University of Waterloo** (Waterloo, Ontario)
- **Université de Sherbrooke** (Sherbrooke, Quebec)
- **Carleton University** (Ottawa, Ontario)
- **Queen’s University** (Kingston, Ontario)

These institutions host specialized labs and facilities that CMC Microsystems members can access for research and development purposes. The specific labs and services available can vary depending on the university and the field of study.

## Where is the one in Toronto located?

The CMC Microsystems network in Toronto primarily connects with facilities and labs at the **University of Toronto**. 

At the University of Toronto, key facilities related to CMC Microsystems are located in:

- **The Edward S. Rogers Sr. Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE)**: This department hosts various labs focused on microelectronics, photonics, and embedded systems. It's situated in the Bahen Centre for Information Technology at **40 St. George Street, Toronto, Ontario**.
  
- **Toronto Nanofabrication Centre (TNFC)**: Located in the Myhal Centre for Engineering Innovation & Entrepreneurship at **55 St. George Street, Toronto, Ontario**, TNFC is a key facility for nanotechnology research and prototyping.

These locations are central to the University of Toronto's downtown campus and are integral to the research and development activities supported by CMC Microsystems.

## Using this webpage, [Scholarships & Funding](https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/programs/graduate/scholarships-funding) how much funding in total a PhD student can achieve?

For a PhD student at the University of Toronto’s Department of Mechanical & Industrial Engineering (MIE), several funding options are available, which can be combined to achieve a significant total amount:

1. **Graduate Fellowships**: All PhD students in MIE receive a baseline fellowship, which provides around $26,000 per year. 

2. **Scholarships**: Students can apply for various scholarships, such as the **Ontario Graduate Scholarship (OGS)** or the **NSERC Postgraduate Scholarships**. The OGS provides $15,000 per year, while the NSERC awards can be even higher, depending on the specific scholarship.

3. **Top-Up Funding**: Students who receive external awards like the OGS or NSERC might also receive top-up funding from the university, which can add several thousand dollars to their annual support.

4. **Research and Teaching Assistantships**: These positions can provide additional income, often around $10,000 to $15,000 per year.

By combining these sources, a PhD student could potentially receive around $45,000 to $50,000 or more per year, depending on their success in obtaining scholarships and additional funding.
