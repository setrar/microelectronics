What is an oscilloscope?

> Bandwith: 
- Range of frequencies that can be measured
- 10 MHz to 100 MHz recommended

> Sampling Rate: (for Digital Oscilloscope)
- Home many times per second the signal is measured
- Recommended at least 100 MS/s (Mega Samples per seconds)

[MS/s](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/glossary/msps.html) 
```math
\begin{gather}
  \text{MS/s (Mega [Million] Sample per Seconds) } \to 1 * 10^6 \text{ Samples per seconds} \\
  1 \mu s \text{(micro seconds)} \to 1 * 10^{-6} seconds
  
\end{gather}
