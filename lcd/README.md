[Waveshare_ILI9486](https://github.com/ImpulseAdventure/Waveshare_ILI9486)

Arduino library for Waveshare ILI9486 supporting the Waveshare 3.5" & 4" TFT Touch Shields for Arduino. Includes GFX-compatible API and touchscreen driver

 I would be reluctant to adapt their Waveshare driver into the mainline code as it isn't really packaged as a library, the API doesn't follow common convention, nor does it provide much applicability outside of this specific display â€” hence the interest in identifying a suitable alternate library.
