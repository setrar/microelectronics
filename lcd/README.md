I have this screen [3.5inch_RPi_Display](http://www.lcdwiki.com/3.5inch_RPi_Display) and a pico. I am new to screens and could only get that one at the moment. How could I connect them so I can display stuff on it from the pico? I was told "I dont see why it wont work"

- [ ] [üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èchez_man69](https://www.reddit.com/user/chez_man69/)

I did end up solving it. There was no documentation for this model as far as i could find so I used other images to figure it out.

Just need some drivers first

- [ ] [What is the D/C pin on the 1.8" TFT LCD breakout?](https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?t=51949)

> by adafruit_support_bill ¬ª Mon Mar 31, 2014 3:47 pm

That is a data/command pin. SPI has no formal standard and there are lots variations on it. Instead of separate CS pins for data and command, they use one CS pin and the D/C to toggle between them.
 
> by xenoc ¬ª Mon Mar 31, 2014 4:06 pm

Interesting. By this, do you mean that for the LCD controller, the MOSI pin is used for receiving data and commands, and that D/C is set by the master to indicate which it is being sent?

> by adafruit_support_bill ¬ª Mon Mar 31, 2014 4:16 pm

That is right.
