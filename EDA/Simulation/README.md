# Simulation

All the tools you mentioned—**Berkeley SPICE, PSpice, LTspice, QSPICE**—are **SPICE simulators**. SPICE stands for **Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis**, created at UC Berkeley in the 1970s. They are called “spicy” because they’re the **secret sauce for electronics engineers**: they let you simulate circuits before physically building them. That’s pretty hot in the world of electronics! 🔥

Here’s why each is “spicy”:

1. **Berkeley SPICE**

   * The original SPICE simulator from UC Berkeley.
   * Open-source, command-line-driven.
   * Mostly used in academia or by hardcore analog IC designers.
   * “Spicy” because it’s the progenitor of all modern SPICE flavors.

2. **PSpice**

   * Commercial version of SPICE (by Cadence).
   * Adds GUI, libraries, better device models.
   * Often used in PCB-level circuit simulation.
   * “Spicy” because it makes SPICE accessible for engineers who hate command lines.

3. **LTspice**

   * From Analog Devices (used to be Linear Technology).
   * Free, fast, optimized for switching regulators and analog circuits.
   * GUI and waveform viewer included.
   * “Spicy” because it’s free but incredibly powerful—can simulate millions of nodes efficiently.

4. **QSPICE**

   * Less famous; could refer to academic variants or “quick SPICE” implementations.
   * Typically experimental or tailored for specialized simulations.
   * “Spicy” because it experiments with SPICE speed or accuracy improvements.

**The pun:** All of these are “spice” simulators… hence “spicy”! 🌶️ And in a deeper sense, they’re spicy because they allow you to **test circuits virtually**, saving time, money, and possibly your fingers from fried components.

Not exactly—but there’s a connection worth clarifying:

* **Mike Engelhardt** is the creator of **LTspice**. He’s not the inventor of SPICE itself, but he took the Berkeley SPICE foundation and made **LTspice**: fast, free, and widely used.

Here’s the relationship:

1. **Berkeley SPICE** → Original SPICE simulator, created at **UC Berkeley** in the 1970s. Mike Engelhardt was **not involved**.
2. **PSpice** → Commercial version of Berkeley SPICE (Cadence). Also **not Engelhardt’s work**.
3. **LTspice** → Developed by **Mike Engelhardt** (originally at Linear Technology). Uses SPICE engine principles but highly optimized.
4. **QSPICE** → Likely unrelated; mostly academic or experimental versions. Mike Engelhardt didn’t create it.

So: **All SPICE simulators are descendants of Berkeley SPICE**, but only **LTspice is directly associated with Mike Engelhardt**.

### 1️⃣ NGSPICE – The “Open-Source Workhorse”

* **What it is:**
  NGSPICE is a fully **open-source SPICE simulator**, descended from **Berkeley SPICE 3f5**.

  * Runs on Windows, Linux, macOS.
  * Supports analog, digital (simple), and mixed-signal simulations.
  * Can be used in **scripts** or with **GUIs** like KiCad, gEDA, or Qucs.

* **Why it exists:**

  * Berkeley SPICE was **academic / research-only**. Commercial SPICE (PSpice, LTspice) is proprietary.
  * Engineers wanted a **modern, maintained, free SPICE** that could be extended, scripted, or embedded in EDA flows.
  * NGSPICE adds features like:

    * Improved convergence
    * More device models (MOSFETs, BJTs, diodes)
    * Mixed-mode simulation
    * Scripting interface (C API, Python bindings)

* **“Spicy angle”:**

  * Fully open-source → hackable.
  * Works well for automation and integration into open-source PCB / FPGA workflows.
  * Popular in academia and hobbyist communities.

### 2️⃣ Qucs‑S – “Graphical, Symbolic, and Spice-Friendly”

* **What it is:**
  Qucs‑S stands for **Quite Universal Circuit Simulator – SPICE version**.

  * It’s essentially **Qucs with SPICE as the backend**.
  * Qucs itself originally had its **own simulator engine**, but it wasn’t full SPICE.
  * Qucs‑S allows you to use **NGSPICE or other SPICE engines** under a **graphical schematic editor**.

* **Why it exists:**

  * Some engineers want the **drag-and-drop GUI of Qucs**, but the **accuracy and features of SPICE**.
  * Qucs‑S decouples simulation from schematic editing:

    * Draw circuits in Qucs GUI
    * Export netlist to SPICE engine
    * Simulate accurately with NGSPICE / SPICE 3 / other engines

* **“Spicy angle”:**

  * GUI makes circuit creation easier.
  * Leverages **open-source SPICE engines** → avoids proprietary tools like PSpice or LTspice.
  * Great for teaching, prototyping, and mixed analog-digital designs.

### 🔹 So why so many SPICE variants?

| Simulator      | Open / Commercial   | GUI / CLI          | Target                 | Strengths                            |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Berkeley SPICE | Open                | CLI                | IC design              | Original, academic                   |
| PSpice         | Commercial          | GUI                | PCB/Analog             | Industry support                     |
| LTspice        | Freeware            | GUI                | Power/Analog           | Fast, robust, many models            |
| QSPICE         | Commercial / Modern | GUI                | Mixed-mode             | Fast, model generator, modern engine |
| NGSPICE        | Open                | CLI / GUI bindings | Academic / Open-source | Hackable, extensible                 |
| Qucs‑S         | Open                | GUI                | Academic / Hobby       | Visual schematic + SPICE accuracy    |

**Bottom line:**

* **NGSPICE** = open, hackable, scriptable SPICE engine.
* **Qucs‑S** = GUI wrapper that uses SPICE engines like NGSPICE.
* **LTspice / QSPICE** = proprietary / free but tuned for performance, models, and usability.

## **Qucs-S**

Yes — **Qucs-S** (the “Simulations” version of Qucs) is designed to support multiple simulation engines, but it depends on **what engines are actually installed and configured** on your system. Qucs-S primarily supports these engines:

* **Ngspice** – most common, open-source SPICE engine.
* **Xyce** – another SPICE-compatible engine.
* **QSPICE** – less common, mostly Windows-focused.

You **can use QSPICE** in Qucs-S if:

1. You have a version of QSPICE installed on your system.
2. Qucs-S is configured to recognize it as a simulation engine.

### Steps to enable QSPICE in Qucs-S:

1. Open Qucs-S.
2. Go to **Options → Settings → Simulation**.
3. In the “SPICE engine” or “External simulator” field, see if QSPICE appears. If not, you may need to add its path manually.
4. Set the path to the QSPICE executable.
5. Save settings, restart Qucs-S.

Once configured, any SPICE simulation you run can use QSPICE as the backend engine.

⚠️ **Notes / Caveats:**

* QSPICE is primarily Windows-oriented; on Linux/macOS it might not run natively without Wine or similar.
* Some Qucs-S features may not work with all engines (e.g., schematic-to-SPICE translation is tested mainly with Ngspice).
* Make sure your netlist syntax is compatible with QSPICE.
