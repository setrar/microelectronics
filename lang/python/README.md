# Testing the [Electret Microphone Amplifier - MAX4466 with Adjustable Gain](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1063) with ADC Pin


### Hardware Setup

#### Assembly

1. Solder headers onto your Adafruit Electret Microphone

#### Wiring

The electret microphone breakout is an analog input, meaning we can connect it
to one of the ADC pins on the Raspberry Pi Pico. Make the following connections:

##### Analog Microphone

| __Adafruit Electret Microphone__ | __Raspberry Pi Pico__ |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------|
| OUT                              | ADC2 - GP28 - Pin34   |
| GND                              | Any ground pin        |
| VDD                              | 3V3(OUT)    - Pin36   |


You can perform the `A/D` conversion in polling, interrupt & FIFO with DMA mode. The ADC conversion speed per sample is `2Î¼s` that is `500kS/s`. The RP2040 microcontroller operates on a `48MHZ` clock frequency which comes from `USB PLL`. So, its ADC takes a `96` CPU clock cycle to perform one conversion. Therefore, the sampling frequency is :

```math
\frac{(96 x 1 )}{48 \mega Hz} = 2 \micro s \text{ per sample (500kS/s)}
```

```python
import machine
from time import sleep

potPin = 28
myPot = machine.ADC(potPin)

while True:
    potVal = myPot.read_u16()
    print(potVal)
    sleep(.5)
```


```python
import machine
from time import sleep

potPin = 28
myPot = machine.ADC(potPin)

while True:
    potVal = myPot.read_u16()
    voltage = (3.3/65391)*potVal-(144*3.3/65391)
    print(voltage)
    sleep(.5)
```
