Yes — there **are books that effectively teach “digital design patterns”**, even if they don’t always use that exact phrase. Below is a **curated, layered reading list**, from **gate-level thinking (74HC mindset)** up to **HDL/FSM/architecture patterns**. I’ll also tell you *what kind of “patterns”* each book teaches.

# 📚 Digital Design “Design Patterns” — Book Guide

## 1️⃣ **Foundational / Gate-Level Thinking (Your 74HC World)**

### 🔹 *Digital Design* — **M. Morris Mano**

**Why it’s important**

* This is *the* classic bridge between **truth tables → gates → flip-flops → FSMs**
* Every concept maps cleanly to **74HC chips**

**Patterns you learn**

* Combinational logic decomposition
* Canonical forms (minterms / maxterms)
* Encoders / decoders
* Counters, registers, FSMs

✅ Best book if you want to **mentally translate HDL ↔ 74HC wiring**

---

### 🔹 *Digital Logic and Computer Design* — **Morris Mano**

(older but very discrete-logic focused)

**Patterns**

* Gate-level arithmetic
* Control logic
* Register-transfer level (RTL thinking *before* HDL)

---

## 2️⃣ **Modern HDL-Oriented Pattern Thinking**

### 🔹 *Digital Design and Computer Architecture* — **David Harris & Sarah Harris**

⭐ **Highly recommended**

**Why**

* Explicitly teaches **design patterns**, though not using the word
* Shows **HDL snippets + block diagrams + reasoning**

**Patterns you learn**

* FSM templates (Moore vs Mealy)
* Datapath + control separation
* Pipelining
* Registers + combinational logic patterns
* Clocked vs combinational discipline

This book answers:

> “Why does this HDL structure exist?”

---

### 🔹 *FPGA Prototyping by VHDL Examples* — **Pong P. Chu** [ISBN-9780470185315](ISBN-9780470185315.pdf)

**Why**

* Extremely practical
* Each chapter is basically a **design pattern catalog**

**Patterns**

* Edge detectors
* Counters
* Timers
* UARTs
* PWM generators
* Debouncers
* FSM templates

✅ This is *very close* to what you’re doing with 74HC ↔ HDL mapping.

---

## 3️⃣ **FSMs as a Design Pattern Language**

### 🔹 *Practical FSM Design in VHDL* — **Endri Kolla**

**Patterns**

* FSM encoding styles
* Safe FSMs
* Reset strategies
* Output decoding patterns

FSMs are arguably **the most important digital design pattern**, and this book treats them as such.

---

## 4️⃣ **Architecture-Level Patterns (Datapath + Control)**

### 🔹 *Computer Organization and Design* — **Patterson & Hennessy**

**Why it matters**

* Teaches **macro-patterns**, not gates
* Still maps back to gates and registers

**Patterns**

* Register file pattern
* ALU pattern
* Pipeline stages
* Control FSMs
* Bus-based architectures

This is:

> HDL patterns at the **system scale**

---

## 5️⃣ **The “Hidden” Design Pattern Book**

### 🔹 *CMOS VLSI Design* — **Neil Weste & David Harris**

**Why it’s special**

* Shows how **logic patterns become transistor patterns**
* NAND/NOR dominance
* Why HDL synthesis prefers certain structures

**Patterns**

* NAND-based logic factoring
* Timing-driven design
* Fanout patterns
* Datapath regularity

This book connects:

> 74HC → standard cells → FPGA LUTs → ASIC silicon

---

## 6️⃣ **What You’re Actually Discovering (Important Insight)**

There is **no famous “Gang of Four”–style book** titled *Digital Design Patterns* because:

> Digital design patterns are **physical laws**, not software conventions.

Patterns like:

* FSM = registers + combinational logic
* Counter = adder + register + reset
* MUX = selection logic
* Bus = tri-state + enable

…are **inevitable**, not stylistic.

You are essentially rebuilding the **missing mental map**:

```
74HC chips
→ gates
→ RTL
→ HDL
→ FPGA LUTs
→ ASIC standard cells
```

That’s *excellent* engineering instinct.

---

## 7️⃣ If I Had to Recommend Just 3 Books for You

Based on your **74HC + HDL + FPGA + chip-making** trajectory:

1️⃣ **Mano – Digital Design**
2️⃣ **Harris & Harris – Digital Design and Computer Architecture**
3️⃣ **Pong Chu – FPGA Prototyping by VHDL Examples**

That trio *is* a **digital design pattern curriculum**, whether they say so or not.
