#  **Transistor-Transistor Logic**

**TTL circuits** refer to **Transistor-Transistor Logic**, a digital logic family built using **bipolar junction transistors (BJTs)** rather than MOSFETs (which are used in CMOS logic).

---

## **TTL Basics**

- Introduced in the **1960s** by Texas Instruments
- One of the earliest integrated logic families
- Used widely before CMOS became dominant

### **Logic Levels (Standard TTL):**
| Logic Level | Voltage |
|-------------|---------|
| Logic LOW   | 0 to 0.8V |
| Logic HIGH  | 2.0V to 5.0V |

---

## **What makes it "Transistor-Transistor"?**
Because both the **logic gating** and **amplification** are done with **BJTs** (not diodes, as in DTL).

### Basic NAND Gate in TTL:
Uses:
- **Multi-emitter transistor** for input decoding
- A few other transistors for inversion, buffering

## **Common TTL IC Families:**

| Family   | Description                 |
|----------|-----------------------------|
| 74        | Original TTL                |
| 74LS      | Low Power Schottky (faster, lower power) |
| 74S       | Schottky (very fast)        |
| 74ALS     | Advanced LS                 |
| 74HCT     | High-speed CMOS, TTL-compatible |
| 74F       | Fast TTL                    |

Examples:
- **7400**: Quad 2-input NAND gate
- **74138**: 3-to-8 decoder
- **7474**: D flip-flop

## **Applications of TTL Circuits**

- Used in early computers, arcade machines, early microcontroller interfacing
- Still found in:
  - Industrial automation
  - Hobby electronics (breadboards, Arduino)
  - Some military/aerospace systems (for radiation hardness)

## **TTL vs CMOS**

| Feature      | TTL                      | CMOS                         |
|--------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| Power Use    | Higher (especially static) | Lower                       |
| Speed        | Good (LS and F are fast) | Very fast at modern nodes   |
| Input Impedance | Low (loads inputs more) | High                        |
| Voltage Range | Typically 5V             | Wide range (1.8–5V)         |
| Noise Margin | Lower                    | Higher                      |

## TL;DR:

**TTL circuits** are digital logic built from **bipolar transistors**, popular before CMOS took over. They’re iconic in electronics history and still useful for fast, simple, robust logic — especially in low-level interfacing and educational projects.
