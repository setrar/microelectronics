Based on the markings visible in the image, the chips are Digital Logic Integrated Circuits (ICs), specifically from the widely used 7400 series of logic families.
Here is a classification of the chips visible:
🔢 74HC Series Logic Chips
The HC designation stands for High-speed CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor), which is a logic family known for its low power consumption and high operating speed, making it a modern replacement for the older TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic) families.
1. HD74HC05P (Top Left Column)
 * Function: This is a Hex Inverter with Open-Drain Outputs.
   * "Hex" means it contains six (6) independent inverter gates.
   * An Inverter (or NOT gate) performs the logical negation function.
   * "Open-Drain" output allows the outputs of multiple gates to be connected together (wired-OR configuration) and requires an external pull-up resistor.
 * Manufacturer: HD often indicates Hitachi (or sometimes related Japanese manufacturers).
2. MC74HC32AN (Top Right Column)
 * Function: This is a Quad 2-Input OR Gate.
   * "Quad" means it contains four (4) independent gates.
   * An OR gate outputs a logic HIGH (1) if any of its inputs are HIGH (1).
   * It has 2 inputs per gate.
 * Manufacturer: MC indicates Motorola (now part of ON Semiconductor/Freescale).
3. GD74HC32 (Middle Right Column)
 * Function: This is also a Quad 2-Input OR Gate (same function as the MC74HC32AN above).
 * Manufacturer: GS or GD is a common prefix for various manufacturers, often an Asian semiconductor manufacturer like Goldstar (LG) or a similar company.
4. GD74HC11 (Bottom Left Column)
 * Function: This is a Triple 3-Input AND Gate.
   * "Triple" means it contains three (3) independent gates.
   * An AND gate outputs a logic HIGH (1) only if all of its inputs are HIGH (1).
   * It has 3 inputs per gate.
 * Manufacturer: GS or GD (likely the same manufacturer as the 74HC32).
5. M74HC4075 (Bottom Right Column)
 * Function: This is a Triple 3-Input OR Gate.
   * "Triple" means it contains three (3) independent OR gates.
   * It has 3 inputs per gate.
 * Manufacturer: OKI (Oki Electric Industry).
🔍 General IC Information
All the chips appear to be in a DIP (Dual In-line Package) format, which is standard for through-hole mounting on a circuit board. The small circular indentation or notch on one end of the package (pin 1 side) indicates the orientation of the chip.
Would you like to know the pinout diagram for any of these specific chips?

✅ **Summary of types present in the image:**

| Logic Function | Part Numbers            | Count |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ----- |
| NAND (2-input) | M74HC00B1               | 4     |
| NOR (2-input)  | KS74HCTLS02N, SN74HC02N | 5     |
| NOT (Inverter) | KS74HCTLS04N            | 8     |

These are **MOSFET-based CMOS logic ICs**, compatible with 74HC/74HCT logic families.
