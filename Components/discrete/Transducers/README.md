A `transducer` is an `electronic device` that `converts energy` from one form to another. Common examples include :
* `microphones`,
* loudspeakers,
* thermometers,
* position and pressure sensors,
* and `antennas`.

Although not generally thought of as transducers :
* photocells,
* LEDs (light-emitting diodes),
* and even `common light bulbs` are transducers.
