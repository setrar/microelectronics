# **Minimoog**

## **Minimoog** is a classic **analog synthesizer**.

Here’s what makes it analog:

### **What makes the Minimoog analog:**

1. **Voltage-Controlled Oscillators (VCOs):**  
   - Generates sound by producing waveforms (saw, square, triangle, etc.) using analog circuitry.
   - Pitch is controlled by voltage — higher voltage = higher pitch.

2. **Voltage-Controlled Filters (VCFs) and Amplifiers (VCAs):**  
   - Shape the tone and dynamics of the sound with analog components (transistors, capacitors, etc.).
   - The famous **ladder filter** in the Minimoog is fully analog and part of its signature sound.

3. **No digital processing:**  
   - The signal path is 100% analog — no sampling, no DSP, no AD/DA conversion.

### **Is it *entirely* analog?**

- The **original Minimoog Model D** (1970s) is fully analog — signal path, modulation, control.
- Some **modern reissues** (like the Model D reissue or Moog Subsequent series) might include digital **MIDI control or patch memory**, but still retain an **analog signal path**.

### **TL;DR**

- **Yes — the Minimoog is analog.**
- Its sound is generated, shaped, and output via **continuous analog voltages**.
- That’s part of why it sounds “alive” and is so sought-after.
