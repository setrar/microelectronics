# VTR


## **Verilog-to-Routing (VTR)** project

**SymbiFlow** utilizes components from the open-source **Verilog-to-Routing (VTR)** project, particularly the **Versatile Place and Route (VPR)** tool, as part of its FPGA design flow.([Wikipedia][1])

### SymbiFlow's Integration with VTR and VPR

SymbiFlow is an open-source FPGA toolchain that incorporates various tools to provide a comprehensive design flow. In this flow, **VPR** is employed for the **packing, placement, and routing** stages of FPGA design. Specifically, the flow typically follows this sequence:([Wikipedia][1])

1. **Synthesis**: Using **Yosys**, the Verilog code is synthesized into an intermediate representation.
2. **Logic Optimization**: The synthesized design is optimized using **ABC**.
3. **Place and Route**: The optimized design is then processed by **VPR** for packing, placement, and routing.
4. **Bitstream Generation**: Finally, tools like **FASM** are used to generate the FPGA bitstream.([CHIPS Alliance][2], [byu-cpe.github.io][3], [Wikipedia][1])

This integration allows SymbiFlow to support various FPGA architectures, including those from Xilinx and Lattice.&#x20;

### VPR's Role and Capabilities

**VPR** is a key component of the VTR project, developed primarily by the University of Toronto. It is designed to perform:([Wikipedia][1])

* **Packing**: Grouping logical elements into clusters that fit the FPGA's logic blocks.
* **Placement**: Assigning these clusters to specific locations on the FPGA.
* **Routing**: Determining the interconnections between clusters to implement the desired logic.

VPR is highly customizable and supports a wide range of FPGA architectures, making it suitable for both academic research and practical applications. ([CHIPS Alliance][2])

### Interoperability and Future Developments

Efforts are ongoing to enhance interoperability between VPR and other tools within the SymbiFlow ecosystem. For instance, the development of the **FPGA Interchange Format** aims to standardize the representation of FPGA architectures and designs, facilitating smoother transitions between different tools like VPR and nextpnr. ([CHIPS Alliance][2])

In summary, SymbiFlow leverages VPR from the VTR project as a core component for place and route operations, benefiting from its flexibility and support for various FPGA architectures.

Great question ‚Äî the distinction between **VTR** and **VPR** can definitely be confusing because they're closely related. Here's a clear breakdown:

---

## üß© **VTR vs. VPR**

### ‚úÖ **VTR** = **Verilog-to-Routing**

* **VTR** is the **entire toolchain** or **project**.
* It includes multiple tools that go from **Verilog HDL** all the way to **placement and routing**.
* It is mainly used in **FPGA architecture research** and **CAD tool studies**.
* Developed by: **University of Toronto** and collaborators.

**VTR contains:**

* ‚úÖ `ODIN II` ‚Äì Verilog elaboration and parsing
* ‚úÖ `ABC` ‚Äì Logic optimization and technology mapping (from Berkeley)
* ‚úÖ `VPR` ‚Äì Place-and-route engine (the core backend)
* ‚úÖ Auxiliary tools ‚Äì Architecture generator scripts, analysis tools, etc.

---

### üîß **VPR** = **Versatile Place and Route**

* **VPR** is a **component inside VTR**.
* It takes a mapped netlist (LUTs, FFs, DSPs, etc.) and performs:

  * **Packing** (grouping logic elements)
  * **Placement** (deciding where they go on the FPGA fabric)
  * **Routing** (connecting them with wires)
* It‚Äôs **the heart** of the VTR flow, but not the whole story.
