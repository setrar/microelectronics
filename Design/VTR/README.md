# VTR


## **Verilog-to-Routing (VTR)** project

**SymbiFlow** utilizes components from the open-source **Verilog-to-Routing (VTR)** project, particularly the **Versatile Place and Route (VPR)** tool, as part of its FPGA design flow.([Wikipedia][1])

### SymbiFlow's Integration with VTR and VPR

SymbiFlow is an open-source FPGA toolchain that incorporates various tools to provide a comprehensive design flow. In this flow, **VPR** is employed for the **packing, placement, and routing** stages of FPGA design. Specifically, the flow typically follows this sequence:([Wikipedia][1])

1. **Synthesis**: Using **Yosys**, the Verilog code is synthesized into an intermediate representation.
2. **Logic Optimization**: The synthesized design is optimized using **ABC**.
3. **Place and Route**: The optimized design is then processed by **VPR** for packing, placement, and routing.
4. **Bitstream Generation**: Finally, tools like **FASM** are used to generate the FPGA bitstream.([CHIPS Alliance][2], [byu-cpe.github.io][3], [Wikipedia][1])

This integration allows SymbiFlow to support various FPGA architectures, including those from Xilinx and Lattice.&#x20;

### VPR's Role and Capabilities

**VPR** is a key component of the VTR project, developed primarily by the University of Toronto. It is designed to perform:([Wikipedia][1])

* **Packing**: Grouping logical elements into clusters that fit the FPGA's logic blocks.
* **Placement**: Assigning these clusters to specific locations on the FPGA.
* **Routing**: Determining the interconnections between clusters to implement the desired logic.

VPR is highly customizable and supports a wide range of FPGA architectures, making it suitable for both academic research and practical applications. ([CHIPS Alliance][2])

### Interoperability and Future Developments

Efforts are ongoing to enhance interoperability between VPR and other tools within the SymbiFlow ecosystem. For instance, the development of the **FPGA Interchange Format** aims to standardize the representation of FPGA architectures and designs, facilitating smoother transitions between different tools like VPR and nextpnr. ([CHIPS Alliance][2])

In summary, SymbiFlow leverages VPR from the VTR project as a core component for place and route operations, benefiting from its flexibility and support for various FPGA architectures.
