Becoming both a [PCB designer](pcb) and a [chip (ASIC/FPGA) designer](chip) is a multi-year journey, but it depends on your background, dedication, and whether you’re focusing on FPGA first or going straight to ASICs.

Since you already have experience in FPGA, SDR, and DSP, you can accelerate the process. Here’s a realistic timeline for mastering both skills in parallel:

🚀 Phase 1: Electronics & PCB Foundations (3-6 months)

Goal: Master PCB design while improving hardware fundamentals.
✅ Learn PCB layout & design (KiCad, Altium, etc.).
✅ Understand signal integrity, power planes, grounding.
✅ Design and order simple PCBs (e.g., RF front-end, SDR filter).
✅ Learn about fabrication constraints (stack-up, DFM, DFA).
✅ If targeting RF, study microwave PCBs (coplanar waveguides, impedance matching).

💡 Outcome: Comfortable designing and fabricating PCBs.

🚀 Phase 2: FPGA & Digital Logic (6-12 months)

Goal: Master FPGA design, HDL, and digital logic for ASIC preparation.
✅ Improve Verilog/SystemVerilog/VHDL.
✅ Implement DSP blocks (FIR, FFT) and interfaces (I2C, SPI, UART).
✅ Work with Zynq/RFSoC for embedded processing.
✅ Optimize designs with HLS (C-to-FPGA) or Chisel.

📌 Parallel PCB Projects:
	•	Design an FPGA dev board with Lattice ECP5 or Xilinx Artix-7.
	•	Create a high-speed DDR3/DDR4 memory interface PCB.

💡 Outcome: Proficient in FPGA and digital system design, with real hardware experience.

🚀 Phase 3: ASIC Fundamentals & Open-Source Flow (12-24 months)

Goal: Move from FPGA design to custom ASIC design.
✅ Learn logic synthesis (Yosys, Synopsys Design Compiler).
✅ Study Place & Route (OpenROAD, Cadence Innovus).
✅ Run timing analysis (STA, PrimeTime).
✅ Tape out a simple RISC-V core or AI accelerator using SkyWater 130nm.

📌 Parallel PCB Projects:
	•	Design a custom SoC PCB with an FPGA + ASIC hybrid.
	•	Build a high-speed ADC/DAC board for RF DSP.

💡 Outcome: You can design, verify, and fabricate custom ASICs.

🚀 Phase 4: Advanced Specialization (24+ months)

At this stage, you can specialize based on your interests:
🔹 RFIC Design: Mix PCB RF front-end + custom RF ASIC.
🔹 HPC & AI Chips: Build FPGA accelerators & AI ASICs.
🔹 SoC Design: Work on custom RISCV/Linux SoCs for embedded systems.

📌 Real-World Applications:
	•	Build your own SDR with a custom ASIC + FPGA.
	•	Create an AI inference engine on FPGA and port it to ASIC.
	•	Tape out a commercial-grade ASIC and design the carrier PCB.

💡 Final Outcome: You are both a PCB and ASIC designer, capable of designing complete hardware stacks.

⏳ Total Estimated Time to Master Both

🔹 2-3 years – If focusing full-time with structured learning & projects.
🔹 3-5 years – If working part-time or learning alongside other commitments.

Since you already have FPGA & DSP experience, you can cut the total time down by ~6-12 months.

🚀 Fast-Track Strategy

1️⃣ Start with FPGA & PCB design in parallel → Design an RF front-end board.
2️⃣ Move to ASIC flow using open-source tools (Sky130, Efabless).
3️⃣ Prototype your ASIC inside an FPGA + custom PCB system.
4️⃣ Tape out your own ASIC and integrate it into your custom PCB designs.
