# chip designer (IC design engineer)

Becoming a chip designer (IC design engineer) requires deeper knowledge of semiconductor physics, digital/analog circuit design, and EDA tools used in ASIC and FPGA development. Here’s a structured roadmap to designing your own custom chips (ASICs, SoCs, or FPGA IPs).

1. Master the Fundamentals

✅ Learn Semiconductor Physics – How transistors work (MOSFETs, CMOS, FinFETs).
✅ Understand Digital Logic Design – Boolean algebra, logic gates, flip-flops, FSMs.
✅ Study Analog Circuits (if needed) – Op-amps, comparators, ADCs/DACs.
✅ Learn Microprocessor Architecture – RISC vs. CISC, pipelining, caches, etc.

📚 Books:
	•	CMOS VLSI Design – Weste & Harris
	•	Digital Integrated Circuits – Rabaey
	•	Microelectronic Circuits – Sedra & Smith (Analog)

🛠 Simulators:
	•	LTSpice – Circuit simulation.
	•	ngspice / Qucs – Open-source alternatives.
	•	Falstad Circuit Simulator – Good for quick digital logic tests.

2. Learn HDL (VHDL / Verilog / SystemVerilog)

You’ll need Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) to design digital circuits:
🟢 Verilog/SystemVerilog – Industry standard for ASIC and FPGA.
🟣 VHDL – Common in Europe, used in FPGA/RF applications.
🟠 Chisel – Modern hardware design language (Scala-based).

📚 Courses:
	•	nand2tetris (Build your own CPU) – nand2tetris.org
	•	VLSI Design Course – Udemy, Coursera, MIT OCW
	•	Digital Design and Computer Architecture – Harris & Harris

💻 Practice:
	•	Design simple circuits: ALUs, FIFOs, UART, CPU cores
	•	Use GHDL (VHDL) or Icarus Verilog for simulation

3. Work with FPGA Prototyping

Before jumping into ASICs, FPGA prototyping is essential:
✅ Learn Xilinx Vivado, Intel Quartus, Lattice Radiant
✅ Work with FPGA boards (Pico-ICE, Zynq, RFSoC, ECP5)
✅ Implement & test designs in real hardware

🔧 Projects:
	•	Design a RISC-V core (e.g., PicoRV32, VexRiscv)
	•	Create a Signal Processing Module (FFT, FIR filters)
	•	Implement Custom Peripherals (I2C, SPI, DDR controller)

4. Get into ASIC Design & EDA Tools

🛠 ASIC Flow Overview:
	1.	RTL Design (Verilog/VHDL) – Describe the circuit behavior.
	2.	Logic Synthesis (Yosys, Synopsys DC) – Convert RTL to gate-level.
	3.	Place & Route (OpenROAD, Cadence Innovus) – Layout optimization.
	4.	DFT & Timing Analysis (OpenSTA, PrimeTime) – Check for delays.
	5.	GDSII Export & Tapeout (Sky130, GF, TSMC, Intel)

📚 Tools & Open-Source Alternatives:
	•	Yosys – Open-source logic synthesis.
	•	OpenROAD – Free PNR tool.
	•	Magic VLSI / KLayout – IC layout editor.
	•	Sky130 (Google & SkyWater PDK) – Free PDK for IC design.

👨‍🔬 Fabrication Options (MPW Runs)
	•	Efabless (SkyWater 130nm) – Free IC tapeout (Google-funded).
	•	GlobalFoundries, TSMC, Intel Foundry Services – For commercial tapeouts.

5. Learn Analog/Mixed-Signal IC Design (Optional)

If you’re interested in RFICs, ADCs, or power ICs, learn analog design:
✅ Cadence Virtuoso – Standard for custom IC layout.
✅ SPICE Simulation – LTSpice, Spectre, or ngspice.
✅ PLL, ADC/DAC, Bandgap Reference, LDO Design – Essential analog blocks.

📚 Books:
	•	Analog Integrated Circuit Design – Razavi
	•	Design of Analog CMOS Integrated Circuits – Razavi

6. Work on Open-Source IC Design Projects

🚀 Join Open-Source Hardware Communities:
	•	RISC-V community – Build your own CPU.
	•	LibreSilicon / OpenRAM – Custom memory design.
	•	OpenMPW (Efabless) – Get your chip fabricated for free.

🎯 Project Ideas:
	•	Design a RISC-V core and tape it out.
	•	Implement a hardware accelerator (FFT, AI inference, LDPC decoder).
	•	Develop a custom RF front-end for SDR applications.

7. Get a Job or Start a Chip Startup

Once you have hands-on experience, you can:
🛠 Work in ASIC/FPGA design roles at companies like Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, or startups.
📡 Specialize in RF, DSP, or AI accelerators for niche applications.
🛠 Build your own custom ASIC startup (e.g., AI chips, SDR, HFT FPGA solutions).

Final Thoughts

💡 Timeframe:
	•	3-6 months: HDL, FPGA basics, simple RTL design.
	•	6-12 months: FPGA projects, ASIC theory, open-source tools.
	•	1+ year: Advanced chip design, PDK work, first tapeout.
