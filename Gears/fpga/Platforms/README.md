Good one ‚Äî now you‚Äôre asking about two *real* FPGA research tools.

Here‚Äôs the clear comparison:

| Feature            | **OpenFPGA**                                          | **FABulous**                                           |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Goal**           | Create *customizable FPGA architectures* + simulate, and generate Verilog/VTR/OpenROAD flows | Create *physical FPGA layouts* (GDSII) automatically from an FPGA architecture |
| **Focus**          | Architectural exploration (LUTs, routing, memory, etc.) | Layout generation, especially *full chip* GDSII files |
| **Output**         | Bitstreams, Verilog netlists, VPR architecture files    | GDSII layout files ready for ASIC manufacturing |
| **Integration**    | Works with VTR, OpenROAD, and others for logic/placement/routing | Works with VTR + magic/klayout for layout generation |
| **Difficulty**     | Medium to High (requires FPGA architecture understanding) | High (needs layout skills + VLSI understanding) |
| **Use case**       | Simulate or implement a *custom FPGA design* on FPGA or ASIC | Tape-out a *real FPGA chip* (e.g., in Sky130, GF180) |
| **License**        | Open-source (very active)                              | Open-source (but slightly less active)                 |
| **Typical flow**   | Write architecture YAML ‚ûî Generate Verilog ‚ûî Simulate/Synthesize | Write architecture JSON/YAML ‚ûî Generate GDSII layout |

---

**Quick Summary:**
- **OpenFPGA** = design and explore custom FPGA *logic architectures*.
- **FABulous** = take a custom FPGA design and *generate a full ASIC physical layout*.

---
üîµ **Analogy:**  
- OpenFPGA is like designing the *blueprints* of a house (how many rooms, what shape).  
- FABulous is like actually *building* the house (bricks, walls, electricity), ready for the real world.

Would you also like a little **"if you want to tape out"** recommendation between OpenFPGA vs FABulous? üöÄ  
(Depending on whether you want simulation only or actual silicon!)

---

Perfect ‚Äî you want **silicon** (real ASIC chip).  
üëâ Then **OpenFPGA *alone* is not enough**.

If your goal is to *tape out* and *get real GDSII* files for fabrication, you need **FABulous**.

### Here's why:

| | **OpenFPGA** | **FABulous** |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Verilog output (netlist) | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Bitstream generation | ‚úÖ | ‚ö†Ô∏è (only physical bitstreams) |
| Physical GDSII layout | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ (full GDSII) |
| DRC/ERC/LVS clean layouts for foundries | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Sky130/GF180 foundry ready | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Full ASIC flow (magic/klayout integration) | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |

---

### üèóÔ∏è How a **silicon-ready** flow would look:

1. **Use OpenFPGA** (optional):  
   - If you want to **design your own** FPGA architecture (e.g., new LUTs, new switchbox types).
2. **Feed architecture to FABulous**:  
   - FABulous uses your FPGA architecture description.
   - It generates *layout tiles* (LUT tiles, interconnect tiles).
   - It stitches the tiles together into a *real FPGA fabric*.
3. **Run physical verification**:  
   - Run DRC/LVS checks (magic, klayout).
4. **Export GDSII**:  
   - You get a GDSII ready for Skywater130, GF180, etc.
5. **Fabricate chip**:  
   - Send to foundry or shuttle service.

### üöÄ My recommendation:

| Scenario | Tool |
|:--|:--|
| You want **only simulation and experiments** (e.g., on an FPGA board) | **OpenFPGA** |
| You want **real tapeout (ASIC)** | **FABulous** (maybe combined with OpenFPGA) |

---

### üí° Bonus Tip:

If you're working toward **ASIC FPGA silicon**, it's common to:
- Design architecture in **OpenFPGA** (very flexible).
- Port it manually or semi-automatically into **FABulous** format (YAML/JSON).
- Generate real layouts with FABulous.

There's a little glue work required between OpenFPGA and FABulous (they are *not plug-and-play* together), but people do it.

Would you like me to also sketch you a **simple OpenFPGA + FABulous real-world flow diagram**? üéØ (takes like 2 min to draw)  
It helps if you're planning a full project!
