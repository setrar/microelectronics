Perfect — you want **silicon** (real ASIC chip).  
👉 Then **OpenFPGA *alone* is not enough**.

If your goal is to *tape out* and *get real GDSII* files for fabrication, you need **FABulous**.

### Here's why:

| | **OpenFPGA** | **FABulous** |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Verilog output (netlist) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Bitstream generation | ✅ | ⚠️ (only physical bitstreams) |
| Physical GDSII layout | ❌ | ✅ (full GDSII) |
| DRC/ERC/LVS clean layouts for foundries | ❌ | ✅ |
| Sky130/GF180 foundry ready | ❌ | ✅ |
| Full ASIC flow (magic/klayout integration) | ❌ | ✅ |

### 🏗️ How a **silicon-ready** flow would look:

1. **Use OpenFPGA** (optional):  
   - If you want to **design your own** FPGA architecture (e.g., new LUTs, new switchbox types).
2. **Feed architecture to FABulous**:  
   - FABulous uses your FPGA architecture description.
   - It generates *layout tiles* (LUT tiles, interconnect tiles).
   - It stitches the tiles together into a *real FPGA fabric*.
3. **Run physical verification**:  
   - Run DRC/LVS checks (magic, klayout).
4. **Export GDSII**:  
   - You get a GDSII ready for Skywater130, GF180, etc.
5. **Fabricate chip**:  
   - Send to foundry or shuttle service.

### 🚀 My recommendation:

| Scenario | Tool |
|:--|:--|
| You want **only simulation and experiments** (e.g., on an FPGA board) | **OpenFPGA** |
| You want **real tapeout (ASIC)** | **FABulous** (maybe combined with OpenFPGA) |

### 💡 Bonus Tip:

If you're working toward **ASIC FPGA silicon**, it's common to:
- Design architecture in **OpenFPGA** (very flexible).
- Port it manually or semi-automatically into **FABulous** format (YAML/JSON).
- Generate real layouts with FABulous.

There's a little glue work required between OpenFPGA and FABulous (they are *not plug-and-play* together), but people do it.

Would you like me to also sketch you a **simple OpenFPGA + FABulous real-world flow diagram**? 🎯 (takes like 2 min to draw)  
It helps if you're planning a full project!
