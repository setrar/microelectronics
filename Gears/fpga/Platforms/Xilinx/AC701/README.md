# AC701


For the **Artix-7 AC701 Evaluation Kit (HW-A7-AC701 REV 1)**, you **do not** need a separate license for the hardware itself. However, you will need a **Vivado license** to use the Vivado Design Suite for FPGA development, especially for tasks like synthesis, implementation, and debugging.

### License Options:

1. **Vivado WebPACK**: This is a free, limited version of Vivado that supports a wide range of Xilinx FPGAs, including Artix-7 devices. If you only need basic functionality, WebPACK should suffice, and you don't need to purchase an additional license.

2. **Vivado Design Suite HLx Editions**: If you need access to advanced features (like high-performance IP cores, simulation, or specific design tools), you may need a paid license. This includes options like the **Vivado HLx (e.g., Design, System, or Simulation)** editions.

In short:

* For basic development, **Vivado WebPACK** should work.
* For advanced features, you'll need a **paid Vivado license**.
