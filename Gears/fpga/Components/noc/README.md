In many 5G baseband SoCs (especially those designed for base stations, RUs, DUs, or even some high-end UE chips), **there is an internal Network-on-Chip (NoC)** that interconnects different IP blocks:  
- **Modem blocks** (e.g., LDPC encoder/decoder, polar coder/decoder)  
- **Massive MIMO processing units**  
- **Beamforming engines**  
- **Radio front-end control units**  
- **Packet processing engines** (for 5G NR over Ethernet, fronthaul like eCPRI)  
- **CPUs and accelerators (AI, PHY processing, etc.)**  

In those cases, the **5G baseband SoC** has **an embedded NoC** â€” but the **5G standard itself** doesn't say "use a NoC"; it's just **a practical design choice** for high-throughput chips.

ðŸ”¹ **Examples of 5G components that may have an embedded NoC:**  
- Qualcomm's Snapdragon X-series modems  
- Marvell OCTEON Fusion chips  
- Intel and Nokia 5G FPGAs/ASICs  
- Xilinx/Zynq RFSoC devices (for 5G radio units)

In short:  
- **5G (as a technology)** does not *require* NoC, but  
- **5G chips (hardware implementations)** often *internally use* NoC to manage complexity, bandwidth, and parallelism.
