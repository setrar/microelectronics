## 🥇 [Future prospects of the industry](https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA/comments/1191ec0/future_prospects_of_the_industry)


You are asking a question about economics, not technology. For traditional FPGAs, the trends are:

1. High-end competition (ASICs) gets more expensive over time, and

1. The capabilities of "midrange" or "low cost" FPGAs improve generation over generation, but

1. Low-end competition (ARM SoCs) also get more capable over time.

As long as (1) and (2) occur faster than (3), the ecosystem niche occupied by FPGAs keeps growing. As usual, this is a great read: [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7086413]

That's the view on traditional FPGAs - but all of the really interesting high-end action is heterogenous, i.e. SoC FPGAs, RFSoCs, datacentre accelerators, etc. We're seeing a Cambrian explosion of diversity in silicon, which means Intel/AMD have to make huge technological bets. For those of us who use the silicon that results, it's an exciting time to work in the sector.
