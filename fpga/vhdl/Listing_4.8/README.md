To use intermediate signals for the statements between the OR, we'll define two new signals, `A1` and `A2`, and then assign the final output `F3` based on these intermediate signals.

### VHDL Code

```vhdl
library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;

entity my_ckt_f3 is
    Port (
        L, M, N : in  std_logic;
        F3      : out std_logic
    );
end my_ckt_f3;

architecture f3_2 of my_ckt_f3 is
    signal A1, A2 : std_logic;
begin
    -- Implement the intermediate signals
    A1 <= (NOT L) AND (NOT M) AND N;
    A2 <= L AND M;

    -- Implement the final output
    F3 <= A1 OR A2;
end f3_2;
```

### Explanation

#### Entity Declaration

- `my_ckt_f3`: The name of the entity.
- `Port`: This keyword introduces the list of input and output ports for the entity.

#### Ports

- **Input Ports**:
  - `L, M, N`: Input ports of type `std_logic`.
  
- **Output Port**:
  - `F3`: Output port of type `std_logic`.

#### Architecture

- `f3_2`: The name of the architecture associated with the entity `my_ckt_f3`.

#### Signal Declarations

- `A1`, `A2`: Intermediate signals used to store the results of the logic expressions before the OR operation.

#### Logic Implementation

- `A1 <= (NOT L) AND (NOT M) AND N;`: This line assigns the result of the first product term \((\bar{L} \cdot \bar{M} \cdot N)\) to the intermediate signal `A1`.
- `A2 <= L AND M;`: This line assigns the result of the second product term \((L \cdot M)\) to the intermediate signal `A2`.

#### Output Assignment

- `F3 <= A1 OR A2;`: This line combines the intermediate signals `A1` and `A2` using the OR operation to produce the final output `F3`.

This VHDL code now includes intermediate signals `A1` and `A2` to store the results of the individual terms in the logic equation, and then combines them to produce the final output `F3`.
