The diagram you provided represents a D flip-flop with an asynchronous reset. To create a VHDL entity and architecture for this circuit, we need to define the inputs for the data (D), clock (CLK), and asynchronous reset (RST), as well as the output (Q).

### VHDL Code

```vhdl
library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;

entity D_flip_flop is
    Port (
        D   : in  std_logic;
        CLK : in  std_logic;
        RST : in  std_logic;
        Q   : out std_logic
    );
end D_flip_flop;

architecture Behavioral of D_flip_flop is
begin
    process (CLK, RST)
    begin
        if RST = '1' then
            Q <= '0';
        elsif rising_edge(CLK) then
            Q <= D;
        end if;
    end process;
end Behavioral;
```

### Explanation

#### Entity Declaration

- `D_flip_flop`: The name of the entity.
- `Port`: This keyword introduces the list of input and output ports for the entity.

#### Ports

- **Input Ports**:
  - `D`: Input port of type `std_logic`, representing the data input.
  - `CLK`: Input port of type `std_logic`, representing the clock input.
  - `RST`: Input port of type `std_logic`, representing the asynchronous reset input.
  
- **Output Port**:
  - `Q`: Output port of type `std_logic`, representing the output of the flip-flop.

#### Architecture

- `Behavioral`: The name of the architecture associated with the entity `D_flip_flop`.

#### Process

- The process is sensitive to both `CLK` and `RST`.
- If `RST` is high (`1`), the output `Q` is reset to `0` asynchronously.
- If `RST` is low (`0`) and there is a rising edge on `CLK`, the value of `D` is transferred to `Q`.

This VHDL code represents a D flip-flop with an asynchronous reset, matching the provided diagram. The flip-flop stores the value of `D` on the rising edge of `CLK` and resets `Q` to `0` when `RST` is asserted high.
