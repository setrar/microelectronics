## Workflow

In the typical FPGA development workflow:

1.	Synthesis (yosys): Generates a netlist of the design.
2.	Place-and-Route (nextpnr): Takes the netlist, maps it to the FPGAâ€™s physical resources, and outputs an ASCII bitstream file (.asc).
3.	Bitstream Conversion (icepack): Converts the ASCII bitstream (.asc) into a binary bitstream (.bin) that the FPGA hardware can read.


### RTL Synthesis: `Yosys`

```
apio raw 'yosys -h'
```
> Returns
```powershell
Usage: /Users/valiha/.apio/packages/tools-oss-cad-suite/libexec/yosys [options] [<infile> [..]]

    -Q
        suppress printing of banner (copyright, disclaimer, version)

    -T
        suppress printing of footer (log hash, version, timing statistics)

    -q
        quiet operation. only write warnings and error messages to console
        use this option twice to also quiet warning messages

    -v <level>
        print log headers up to level <level> to the console. (this
        implies -q for everything except the 'End of script.' message.)

    -t
        annotate all log messages with a time stamp

    -d
        print more detailed timing stats at exit

    -l logfile
        write log messages to the specified file

    -L logfile
        like -l but open log file in line buffered mode

    -o outfile
        write the design to the specified file on exit

    -b backend
        use this backend for the output file specified on the command line

    -f frontend
        use the specified frontend for the input files on the command line

    -H
        print the command list

    -h command
        print the help message for the specified command

    -s scriptfile
        execute the commands in the script file

    -c tcl_scriptfile
        execute the commands in the tcl script file (see 'help tcl' for details)

    -C
        enters TCL interatcive shell mode

    -p command
        execute the commands (to chain commands, separate them with semicolon + whitespace: 'cmd1; cmd2')

    -m module_file
        load the specified module (aka plugin)

    -X
        enable tracing of core data structure changes. for debugging

    -M
        will slightly randomize allocated pointer addresses. for debugging

    -A
        will call abort() at the end of the script. for debugging

    -r <module_name>
        elaborate command line arguments using the specified top module

    -D <macro>[=<value>]
        set the specified Verilog define (via "read -define")

    -P <header_id>[:<filename>]
        dump the design when printing the specified log header to a file.
        yosys_dump_<header_id>.il is used as filename if none is specified.
        Use 'ALL' as <header_id> to dump at every header.

    -W regex
        print a warning for all log messages matching the regex.

    -w regex
        if a warning message matches the regex, it is printed as regular
        message instead.

    -e regex
        if a warning message matches the regex, it is printed as error
        message instead and the tool terminates with a nonzero return code.

    -E <depsfile>
        write a Makefile dependencies file with in- and output file names

    -x <feature>
        do not print warnings for the specified experimental feature

    -g
        globally enable debug log messages

    -V
        print version information and exit

The option -S is an shortcut for calling the "synth" command, a default
script for transforming the Verilog input to a gate-level netlist. For example:

    yosys -o output.blif -S input.v

For more complex synthesis jobs it is recommended to use the read_* and write_*
commands in a script file instead of specifying input and output files on the
command line.

When no commands, script files or input files are specified on the command
line, yosys automatically enters the interactive command mode. Use the 'help'
command to get information on the individual commands.

### Bitstream Conversion: `icepack`

icepack is a tool used in the FPGA toolchain for Lattice iCE40 FPGAs (including the UP5K). Its primary function is to convert an ASCII-format bitstream file (with an .asc extension) into a binary-format bitstream file (with a .bin extension) that can be loaded onto an FPGA.

```
apio raw 'icepack -h'
```
> Returns
```powershell
Usage: /Users/valiha/.apio/packages/tools-oss-cad-suite/libexec/icepack [options] [input-file [output-file]]

    -u
        unpack mode (implied when called as 'iceunpack')

        repeat to flip the selection of tiles

    -r
        write bram data, not cram, to the netpbm file

    -B0, -B1, -B2, -B3
        only include the specified bank in the netpbm file

    -n
        skip initializing BRAM
```

## Differences

Vivado and APIO are both used in FPGA development, but they differ significantly in scope, functionality, and target audience. Hereâ€™s a detailed comparison:

1. Tool Type and Ecosystem

	â€¢	Vivado:
	â€¢	A proprietary software suite from Xilinx (now part of AMD), specifically for Xilinx FPGAs (such as the Zynq, Artix, Kintex, and Virtex families).
	â€¢	Itâ€™s a comprehensive, all-in-one solution that includes synthesis, simulation, place-and-route, bitstream generation, IP integration, and advanced debugging tools.
	â€¢	APIO:
	â€¢	An open-source tool that acts as a high-level interface to simplify and automate workflows for multiple FPGA platforms, especially open-source-friendly FPGAs like the Lattice iCE40 family.
	â€¢	APIO is designed to integrate various open-source tools (such as Yosys, nextpnr, and openFPGALoader) into a streamlined workflow, without performing any synthesis, place-and-route, or debugging directly.

2. Supported Hardware

	â€¢	Vivado:
	â€¢	Exclusively supports Xilinx FPGAs. It provides optimized workflows for these FPGAs and includes IP cores, block design tools, and optimized place-and-route algorithms tailored to Xilinx architectures.
	â€¢	Not compatible with non-Xilinx FPGAs.
	â€¢	APIO:
	â€¢	Primarily used with open-source-friendly FPGAs such as the Lattice iCE40 and ECP5 series, but also supports some other FPGAs that work with open-source tools.
	â€¢	Not specific to a particular vendor, as it relies on tools that support multiple architectures.

3. Feature Set

	â€¢	Vivado:
	â€¢	A feature-rich suite with synthesis, simulation, IP integration, high-level synthesis (HLS), block design, debugging, and power analysis.
	â€¢	Includes advanced features like system-level simulation (for SoCs), timing analysis, and constraint management.
	â€¢	Offers a graphical user interface (GUI) along with a command-line interface (CLI) for more advanced users.
	â€¢	APIO:
	â€¢	Provides a simplified command-line interface to organize and run open-source tools. APIO itself does not handle synthesis or simulation but coordinates with external open-source tools to perform these tasks.
	â€¢	Does not have a built-in GUI or advanced features like Vivadoâ€™s IP integrator or power analysis tools.

	â€¢	Primarily CLI-based and abstracts away many complexities of the individual tools in the open-source toolchain.
	â€¢	Itâ€™s ideal for simpler projects or users who want to leverage open-source tools without diving into the intricacies of each.

5. Cost and Licensing

	â€¢	Vivado:
	â€¢	Proprietary and requires a license, which can be costly, although Xilinx provides a limited free version called Vivado WebPACK with reduced functionality.
	â€¢	The full-featured versions of Vivado require a paid license, which can be a significant expense.
	â€¢	APIO:
	â€¢	Completely free and open-source, supporting workflows that avoid licensing costs.
	â€¢	Compatible with free, open-source tools like Yosys, nextpnr, and Project IceStorm, making it accessible to anyone.

6. Typical Users

	â€¢	Vivado:
	â€¢	Used by professional engineers, researchers, and companies working on commercial, high-performance FPGA designs, especially those requiring advanced verification, IP cores, and detailed optimization.
	â€¢	Essential for designs on Xilinx FPGAs, as it is the primary official toolchain.
	â€¢	APIO:
	â€¢	Geared toward hobbyists, students, and open-source FPGA developers.
	â€¢	Popular in the open hardware community for users who want to work on open-source-friendly FPGAs without requiring proprietary tools.

Summary

-	Vivado is a comprehensive, proprietary suite designed for professional-grade, Xilinx-specific FPGA development with a wide array of features.
-	APIO is an open-source, user-friendly interface for coordinating open-source tools in FPGA development, especially for Lattice and other open-source-supported FPGAs, and is ideal for simpler, cost-effective FPGA projects.

In short, Vivado is essential for advanced, Xilinx-specific projects, while APIO offers a lightweight and open-source alternative for less complex designs on open-source-compatible FPGAs.
