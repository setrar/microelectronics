# 3. Sequential Logic

* Covers [SR latches](1.SR%20Latch), [D latches](2.D%20Latch), [D flip-flops](3.D%20flip-flop), [JK flip-flops](4.JK%20flip-flop), T flip-flops.
* Why: FPGAs are inherently synchronous. State machines and pipelines depend on these.
* Skills: Understand setup/hold time, clock skew, metastability.
