# 3. Sequential Logic

* Covers [SR latches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM0DdEaY5sY), [D latches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peCh_859q7Q), D flip-flops, JK flip-flops, T flip-flops.
* Why: FPGAs are inherently synchronous. State machines and pipelines depend on these.
* Skills: Understand setup/hold time, clock skew, metastability.
