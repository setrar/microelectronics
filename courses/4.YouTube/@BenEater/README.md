| [SR latch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM0DdEaY5sY) | | 
| [D latch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peCh_859q7Q) | Building on the SR latch from the previous video (   • SR latch  ), the D latch  makes it easier to store a single bit of data. |
| [D flip-flop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW-_GkUguMM) | Building on the D latch from the previous video (   • D latch  ), the D flip-flop has a "clock" input instead of an "enable" input and stores data just on the rising edge of the clock. |
