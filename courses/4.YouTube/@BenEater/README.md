| [SR latch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM0DdEaY5sY) | Digital logic gets really interesting when we connect the output of gates back to an input. The SR latch is one of the most basic memory circuits that we can build on to make counters, registers, and all sorts of other interesting things. | 
| [D latch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peCh_859q7Q) | Building on the SR latch from the previous video (   • SR latch  ), the D latch  makes it easier to store a single bit of data. |
| [D flip-flop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW-_GkUguMM) | Building on the D latch from the previous video (   • D latch  ), the D flip-flop has a "clock" input instead of an "enable" input and stores data just on the rising edge of the clock. |
