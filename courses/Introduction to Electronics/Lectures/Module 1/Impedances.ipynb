    "## Frequency \n",
    "\n",
    "The **same signal frequency** can be represented in both **Hertz (Hz)** and **radians per second (rad/s)**, but they are different units and convey slightly different information. Here's how they relate to each other:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Hertz (Hz):**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Hertz is the unit of frequency in cycles per second.\n",
    "   - **Meaning:** It represents how many complete cycles (oscillations) of a signal occur in one second.\n",
    "   - **Example:** A signal with a frequency of 50 Hz completes 50 cycles per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Radians per Second (rad/s):**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Radians per second is the unit of angular frequency.\n",
    "   - **Meaning:** It represents the rate of change of the phase angle of the signal in radians per second.\n",
    "   - **Example:** A signal with an angular frequency of 100π rad/s oscillates at a rate of 100π radians per second.\n",
    "\n",

    "### **Relationship Between Hz and rad/s:**\n",
    "The two units are related by the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\omega = 2\\pi f$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $\\omega$ = angular frequency in **rad/s**\n",
    "- $f$ = frequency in **Hz**\n",
    "- $2\\pi$ = conversion factor (since one full cycle corresponds to $2\\pi$ radians)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### **Example Conversion:**\n",
    "If a signal has a frequency of $f = 50 \\, \\text{Hz}$, its angular frequency $\\omega$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\omega = 2\\pi \\times 50 = 100\\pi \\, \\text{rad/s}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if a signal has an angular frequency of $\\omega = 200\\pi \\, \\text{rad/s}$, its frequency in Hz is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi} = \\frac{200\\pi}{2\\pi} = 100 \\, \\text{Hz}$\n",

    "### **When to Use Which:**\n",
    "- **Hertz (Hz):** Used when describing the frequency of signals in terms of cycles per second (e.g., power line frequency, audio signals).\n",
    "- **Radians per Second (rad/s):** Used in mathematical analysis, especially in equations involving phase angles, such as in AC circuit analysis, control systems, and signal processing.\n",

    "### **Summary:**\n",
    "- The same signal frequency can be represented in **Hz** (cycles per second) or **rad/s** (radians per second).\n",
    "- They are related by the formula $\\omega = 2\\pi f$.\n",

    "## Visualizing **radians per second (rad/s)** \n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizing **radians per second (rad/s)** can be a bit abstract at first, but it becomes clearer when you connect it to the motion of a rotating object or the oscillation of a wave. Let me break it down for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. What is a Radian?**\n",
    "   - A **radian** is a unit of angular measure.\n",
    "   - It is defined as the angle subtended at the center of a circle by an arc whose length is equal to the radius of the circle.\n",
    "   - In simpler terms: If you take a circle and \"unroll\" its radius along the circumference, the angle created at the center is **1 radian**.\n",
    "   - A full circle ($360^\\circ$) corresponds to $2\\pi$ radians (since the circumference of a circle is $2\\pi r$, where $r$ is the radius).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. What Does Radian/Second (rad/s) Represent?**\n",
    "   - **Radian per second (rad/s)** is a measure of **angular velocity**.\n",
    "   - It tells you how fast an object is rotating or how quickly an angle is changing over time.\n",
    "   - For example:\n",
    "     - If an object rotates at **1 rad/s**, it means the angle changes by **1 radian every second**.\n",
    "     - If it rotates at **2π rad/s**, it completes **one full rotation (360°)** every second.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Visualizing Rad/s:**\n",
    "Here are some ways to visualize **rad/s**:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **a. Rotating Wheel or Fan:**\n",
    "   - Imagine a wheel or fan spinning.\n",
    "   - If it rotates at **1 rad/s**, it means the wheel turns through an angle of **1 radian (≈57.3°)** every second.\n",
    "   - If it rotates at **2π rad/s**, it completes **one full rotation (360°)** every second.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **b. Pendulum or Oscillating Wave:**\n",
    "   - Think of a pendulum swinging back and forth or a sine wave oscillating.\n",
    "   - The angular frequency ($\\omega$) in **rad/s** tells you how quickly the pendulum or wave oscillates.\n",
    "   - For example:\n",
    "     - A pendulum with $\\omega = 2 \\, \\text{rad/s}$ oscillates at a rate of **2 radians per second**.\n",
    "     - A sine wave with $\\omega = 100\\pi \\, \\text{rad/s}$ oscillates much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **c. Clock Hands:**\n",
    "   - The second hand of a clock rotates at **$\\frac{\\pi}{30} \\, \\text{rad/s}$**:\n",
    "     - It completes one full rotation ($2\\pi$ radians) in **60 seconds**.\n",
    "     - So, $\\omega = \\frac{2\\pi}{60} = \\frac{\\pi}{30} \\, \\text{rad/s}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Relating Rad/s to Hz:**\n",
    "   - **Hertz (Hz)** measures frequency in **cycles per second**.\n",
    "   - **Rad/s** measures angular frequency in **radians per second**.\n",
    "   - The two are related by the formula:\n",
    "$\\omega = 2\\pi f$\n",
    "     where:\n",
    "     - $\\omega$ = angular frequency in **rad/s**\n",
    "     - $f$ = frequency in **Hz**\n",
    "   - For example:\n",
    "     - A signal with $f = 1 \\, \\text{Hz}$ has $\\omega = 2\\pi \\, \\text{rad/s}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Practical Example:**\n",
    "   - Suppose a wheel rotates at **10 rad/s**.\n",
    "   - This means:\n",
    "     - The wheel turns through **10 radians every second**.\n",
    "     - Since $2\\pi \\approx 6.28$ radians is one full rotation, the wheel completes:\n",
    "$\\frac{10}{2\\pi} \\approx 1.59 \\, \\text{rotations per second}.$\n",
    "     - In terms of frequency, this is approximately **1.59 Hz**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Summary:**\n",
    "- **Rad/s** measures how quickly an angle changes over time.\n",
    "- It can be visualized as the speed of rotation (e.g., a spinning wheel) or the rate of oscillation (e.g., a pendulum or wave).\n",
    "- **1 rad/s** means the angle changes by **1 radian every second**.\n",
    "- To convert to **Hz**, use $\\omega = 2\\pi f$.\n"
