        "\n",
        "**Steady-state sinusoidal inputs** refer to sinusoidal signals (e.g., sine or cosine waves) that are applied to a system and have been present for a sufficiently long time so that any transient effects (initial disturbances or responses) have decayed to zero. At this point, the system's response is entirely characterized by the sinusoidal input, and the output is also a sinusoidal signal with the same frequency but potentially different amplitude and phase.\n",
