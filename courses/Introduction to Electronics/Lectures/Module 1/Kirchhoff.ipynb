    "## Kirchhoff's Circuit Laws\n",
    "\n",
    "Kirchhoff's Circuit Laws are fundamental principles in electrical engineering and physics, used to analyze electrical circuits. They consist of two main laws: Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) and Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL):**\n",
    "   - **Statement:** The algebraic sum of currents entering and leaving a node (or junction) in an electrical circuit is zero.\n",
    "   - **Mathematically:** $\\sum I_{\\text{in}} = \\sum I_{\\text{out}}$\n",
    "   - **Explanation:** This law is based on the principle of conservation of electric charge. It states that the total current flowing into a junction must equal the total current flowing out of the junction. In other words, charge cannot accumulate at a node.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL):**\n",
    "   - **Statement:** The algebraic sum of all voltages around any closed loop in a circuit is zero.\n",
    "   - **Mathematically:** $\\sum V = 0$\n",
    "   - **Explanation:** This law is based on the principle of conservation of energy. It states that the total voltage supplied by sources (like batteries) in any closed loop must equal the total voltage dropped across the components (like resistors, capacitors, etc.) in that loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- **KCL** is used to analyze currents at nodes or junctions in a circuit.\n",
    "- **KVL** is used to analyze voltages around loops or meshes in a circuit.\n",
    "- Both laws are essential for solving complex circuits, especially when combined with Ohm's Law ($V = IR$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "Consider a simple circuit with a battery and two resistors in series:\n",
    "- **KCL:** At any junction, the current entering equals the current leaving.\n",
    "- **KVL:** The sum of the voltage drops across the resistors equals the voltage supplied by the battery.\n",
    "\n",
    "These laws are foundational for circuit analysis and are widely used in both theoretical and practical applications."
