    "### Voltage Follower Configuration:\n",
    "- In a voltage follower, the output of the op-amp is directly connected to the inverting input (-), and the input signal $V_{in}$ is applied to the non-inverting input (+).\n",

    "1. **Voltage Follower Configuration**:\n",

    "   - The output of the op-amp is connected directly to the load, which in this case is the resistor $R = 10 \\, \\Omega$.\n",
