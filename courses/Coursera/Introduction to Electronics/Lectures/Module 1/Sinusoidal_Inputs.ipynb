    "## **Steady-state sinusoidal inputs**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steady-state sinusoidal inputs** refer to sinusoidal signals (e.g., sine or cosine waves) that are applied to a system and have been present for a sufficiently long time so that any transient effects (initial disturbances or responses) have decayed to zero. At this point, the system's response is entirely characterized by the sinusoidal input, and the output is also a sinusoidal signal with the same frequency but potentially different amplitude and phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Key Characteristics of Steady-State Sinusoidal Inputs**\n",
    "   - **Sinusoidal Waveform:** The input signal is of the form:\n",
    "$x(t) = A \\sin(\\omega t + \\phi)$\n",
    "     where:\n",
    "     - $A$ = amplitude\n",
    "     - $\\omega$ = angular frequency (in rad/s)\n",
    "     - $\\phi$ = phase angle (in radians)\n",
    "   - **Steady-State:** The system has reached a stable, long-term response to the input, and transient effects have disappeared.\n",
    "   - **Same Frequency:** The output signal has the same frequency as the input signal but may have a different amplitude and phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Why Sinusoidal Inputs are Important**\n",
    "   - Sinusoidal signals are fundamental in analyzing **linear time-invariant (LTI) systems** because:\n",
    "     - They are **eigenfunctions** of LTI systems, meaning the output is also a sinusoid with the same frequency.\n",
    "     - They allow us to study system behavior in the **frequency domain**.\n",
    "   - Sinusoidal inputs are used to characterize systems in terms of their **frequency response** (amplitude and phase changes at different frequencies).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Steady-State Response to Sinusoidal Inputs**\n",
    "   - For an LTI system with a sinusoidal input, the steady-state output is:\n",
    "$y(t) = B \\sin(\\omega t + \\phi + \\theta)$\n",
    "     where:\n",
    "     - $B$ = amplitude of the output (depends on the system's gain at frequency $\\omega$)\n",
    "     - $\\theta$ = phase shift introduced by the system\n",
    "   - The relationship between the input and output is described by the system's **frequency response**:\n",
    "$H(j\\omega) = \\frac{Y(j\\omega)}{X(j\\omega)}$\n",
    "     where:\n",
    "     - $H(j\\omega)$ = frequency response (complex function)\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Frequency Response and Impedance**\n",
    "   - In electrical circuits, the **frequency response** is often related to **impedance**:\n",
    "     - For a circuit with impedance $Z(j\\omega)$, the output voltage ($V_{\\text{out}}$) for a sinusoidal input voltage ($V_{\\text{in}}$) is:\n",
    "$V_{\\text{out}}(j\\omega) = H(j\\omega) \\cdot V_{\\text{in}}(j\\omega)$\n",
    "     - The frequency response $H(j\\omega)$ depends on the circuit's impedance and topology.\n",

    "### **5. Applications of Steady-State Sinusoidal Inputs**\n",
    "   - **AC Circuit Analysis:** Used to analyze circuits with alternating current (AC) signals.\n",
    "   - **Filter Design:** Used to design and analyze filters (e.g., low-pass, high-pass, band-pass).\n",
    "   - **Control Systems:** Used to study the frequency response of control systems and design controllers.\n",
    "   - **Signal Processing:** Used to analyze and process signals in communication systems, audio systems, and more.\n",
    "   - **Impedance Matching:** Used to match impedances in RF and audio systems for maximum power transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Example: RC Circuit**\n",
    "   - Consider an **RC circuit** (resistor and capacitor in series) with a sinusoidal input voltage:\n",
    "$V_{\\text{in}}(t) = A \\sin(\\omega t)$\n",
    "   - The steady-state output voltage across the capacitor is:\n",
    "$V_{\\text{out}}(t) = \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{1 + (\\omega RC)^2}} \\sin(\\omega t + \\theta)$\n",
    "     where:\n",
    "     - $\\theta = -\\tan^{-1}(\\omega RC)$ (phase shift)\n",

    "\n",
    "### **7. Summary**\n",
    "   - **Steady-state sinusoidal inputs** are sinusoidal signals applied to a system after transient effects have decayed.\n",
    "   - The system's response is also sinusoidal, with the same frequency but potentially different amplitude and phase.\n",
    "   - These inputs are fundamental for analyzing **LTI systems** in the frequency domain and are widely used in **AC circuits**, **filters**, **control systems**, and **signal processing**.\n",

    "### **2. Configure Vertical Settings (Amplitude)**\n",
    "1. **Coupling**:\n",
    "   - **DC Coupling**: Shows the entire signal (AC + DC components). Use this for most general-purpose measurements.\n",

    "1. **Connect the Probe**:\n",

    "### **Key Notes**\n",
    "- **Impedance**: The AD3â€™s scope input has a fixed **1 MÎ© impedance** (parallel with ~15 pF capacitance). No external resistors are needed for most measurements.\n",
    "- **Bandwidth**: The AD3â€™s scope has a **30 MHz bandwidth**, so signals above this frequency will attenuate.\n",

    "### **Verification**\n",

    "## Correction with AutoSet\n",
    "\n",
    "The **AutoSet** feature in the oscilloscope automatically adjusts the **timebase (horizontal scale)**, **vertical scale**, and **trigger settings** to stabilize and properly display your signal. Hereâ€™s why setting the **timebase to 200 Âµs/div** (likely via AutoSet) resolved the dual-sinusoid issue:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why It Happened and How AutoSet Fixed It**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Incorrect Timebase**:\n",
    "   - If the original timebase was set too **fast** (e.g., 1 Âµs/div), the oscilloscope might have displayed **multiple cycles** of the waveform overlapping or aliasing, creating the illusion of two signals.\n",
    "   - If the timebase was too **slow** (e.g., 1 ms/div), the waveform might not have been triggered properly, causing the scope to display untriggered traces.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Trigger Settings**:\n",
    "   - AutoSet likely adjusted the **trigger level** to stabilize the waveform. Without proper triggering, the scope displays multiple unsynchronized traces (which look like two sinusoids).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Vertical Scale**:\n",
    "   - AutoSet may have adjusted the **volts/div** to ensure the waveform fits on the screen without clipping or distortion.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What AutoSet Did Behind the Scenes**\n",
    "- **Optimized Timebase**: Set the horizontal scale to **200 Âµs/div**, ensuring 1â€“2 full cycles of the waveform are displayed (assuming a frequency of ~1â€“5 kHz).  \n",
    "  Example: For a **1 kHz signal** (period = 1 ms = 1000 Âµs), 200 Âµs/div shows ~5 cycles across the 10-division grid.  \n",
    "- **Stabilized Trigger**: Set the trigger to **edge mode** on the rising/falling edge of the waveform, synchronizing the display.  \n",
    "- **Adjusted Vertical Scale**: Set the **volts/div** to ensure the waveform amplitude fills ~â…” of the screen.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Two Sinusoids Appeared Earlier**\n",
    "- **Untriggered Signal**: The scope was likely in **auto-trigger mode**, continuously refreshing and overlapping old/new traces.  \n",
    "- **Aliasing**: A poorly chosen timebase could have caused signal aliasing (e.g., displaying a false low-frequency waveform).  \n",
    "- **Noise or Ground Loops**: If the ground connection was unstable, the scope might have picked up noise as a second signal.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Lessons**\n",
    "1. **AutoSet is Your Friend**: Use it when unsure about scope settings. It optimizes timebase, vertical scale, and triggering.  \n",
    "2. **Check Grounding**: Always ensure a solid ground connection between the WaveGen and Scope.  \n",
    "3. **Trigger Matters**: A stable trigger eliminates overlapping traces.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Manual Setup to Replicate AutoSet**\n",
    "If you want to configure the scope manually next time:\n",
    "1. **Timebase**: Calculate based on signal frequency:  \n",
    "$\\text{Time/div} = \\frac{\\text{Period}}{5} \\quad \\text{(to show ~2 cycles)}$\n",
    "   Example: For 1 kHz (period = 1 ms), set **200 Âµs/div**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Trigger**:  \n",
    "   - Source: **Channel 1**.  \n",
    "   - Type: **Edge (rising or falling)**.  \n",
    "   - Level: **Midpoint of the waveform** (e.g., 0V for a Â±5V signal).  \n",
