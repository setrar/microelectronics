    "Q 1) What is the minimum transmit power required to send a signal to the moon  (when closest to Earth), such that the signal is properly received by a receiver with sensitivity of -120 dBm and a signal frequency of 400 MHz? Consider TX and RX antenna gains of 10 dB and neglect the impact of the atmosphere in the signal."

    "$^{(1)}$ The value **32.45 dB** in the free-space path loss formula arises from unit conversions and constants in the **Friis transmission equation**. Here‚Äôs the breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Derivation of the Constant**\n",
    "The original free-space path loss formula in linear terms is:\n",
    "$\\text{Path Loss (PL)} = \\left( \\frac{4\\pi d}{\\lambda} \\right)^2$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $d$ = distance (meters),\n",
    "- $\\lambda$ = wavelength (meters) = $c / f$ (where $c = \\text{speed of light}, f = \\text{frequency in Hz}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert this to **decibels (dB)** and use units of **distance in kilometers (km)** and **frequency in MHz**, the formula becomes:\n",
    "$\\text{Path Loss (dB)} = 20 \\log_{10}(d_{\\text{km}}) + 20 \\log_{10}(f_{\\text{MHz}}) + 32.45$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Where does 32.45 come from?**\n",
    "1. **Convert $d$ to km and $f$ to MHz:**\n",
    "   - $d_{\\text{km}} = d_{\\text{m}} / 1000$,\n",
    "   - $f_{\\text{MHz}} = f_{\\text{Hz}} / 10^6$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Substitute constants into the equation:**\n",
    "   - Speed of light, $c = 3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}$,\n",
    "   - $4\\pi/c$ in logarithmic terms:  \n",
    "$20 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{c}\\right) \\approx -147.55 \\, \\text{dB}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Account for unit conversions:**\n",
    "   - $20 \\log_{10}(1000) = 60 \\, \\text{dB}$ (from km),\n",
    "   - $20 \\log_{10}(10^6) = 120 \\, \\text{dB}$ (from MHz).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Combine all terms:**\n",
    "$-147.55 + 60 + 120 = 32.45 \\, \\text{dB}.$\n",

    "The **32.45 dB** is a constant that accounts for:\n",
    "- The $4\\pi/c$ term in the Friis equation,\n",
    "- Unit conversions (distance to kilometers and frequency to MHz).\n",
