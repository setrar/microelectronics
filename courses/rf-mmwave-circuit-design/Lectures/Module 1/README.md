# Introduction to RF & mm-Wave Circuit Design Course


This module will introduce the student to the RF and mm-Wave Circuit Design course and to the topic of wireless systems. It will present the learning objectives, grading system, supporting material, introductory class, and design labs. Besides, it will show the student how to use the simulation tools and the equipment used in the design labs.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the technical system specification of a wireless system
- Understand the transceiver specifications and relate them to the system specifications
- Understand single-path transceiver architectures
- Understand the RF circuit/function specifications and relate them to the transceiver specifications
- Be able to design, simulate and implement several RF blocks, e.g. LNA, PA, filters, mixers, oscillators circuits
- Be able to perform experiments and measurements with RF transceiver circuits
