# Supporting Material

Dear student,

Please, find below the supporting material for the lecture about Introduction to Design Labs.

1 - Presentation Notes from the video.

- [ ] [Design Labs.pdf](docs/Design%20Labs.pdf)

2 - List of Equipment

> The lab implementation in breadboard (using real components) is optional for obtaining the certificate, but it is recommend because that is where all the fun is!

The student can acquire the following components and equipment in order to be able to implement and measure the RF circuit assignments. Unfortunately, we cannot provide the students with these tools, nor purchase any item for them. Therefore, it is the studentsâ€™ **entire** responsibility to purchase/acquire such components. We kindly suggest the following list of components, however we do not take any responsibility on the quality of the service provided by the vendor, nor any further issues one might encounter during the purchasing process, e.g., import tax, or defect component. If desired, the students can also opt for any other equivalent  component/equipment that best suits them.
