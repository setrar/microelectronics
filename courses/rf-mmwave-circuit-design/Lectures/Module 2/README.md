# Wireless Systems

The module on Wireless Systems will introduce the student to the history of wireless technologies, wireless system design, and RF system specifications. Concepts about transceivers will be detailed, such as path loss, interference signals, receiver sensitivity, and transmitter output power. It also includes the first design lab, the system design of a Wireless Tin Can Telephone.
